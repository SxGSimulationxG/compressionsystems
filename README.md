This repository was created for my W-Seminar project on Huffman and Shannon-Fano Coding. 
The resulting paper is saved as "gerMain.pdf" as well as "gerMain.tex" in "/paper". The paper itself was made using TeXStudio (https://www.texstudio.org/).
The folders "/src", "/.idea" were used for the programming of the comparison system. This comparison system was made using the IntelliJ IDE Community Edition and Java. 
The folder "/manimations" includes all the figures made using the Manim Community Edition (https://www.manim.community/) and python.
All the references in the paper are saved as .pdf, .txt, or .html files in "/ReferenceFiles".
"ReferenceFiles/mackenzie1980CodedCharSets" was too large to import as a .pdf so to view you need to install the .zip file and extract.
