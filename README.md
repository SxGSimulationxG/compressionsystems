This repository was created for my W-Seminar project on Huffman and Shannon-Fano Coding. 
The resulting paper is saved as "gerMain.pdf" as well as "gerMain.tex" in "/paper". The paper itself was made using TeXStudio (https://www.texstudio.org/).
The folders "/src", "/.idea" were used for the programming of the comparison system. This comparison system was made using the IntelliJ IDE Community Edition, Codex, and Java. 
The folder "/manimations" includes all the figures made using the Manim Community Edition (https://www.manim.community/) and python.
All references in the paper are saved as .pdf, .txt, or .html files in "/ReferenceFiles".
In "ComparisonSystemResults.pdf" and "ComparisonSystemResults.xlsx" are the results from the comparison system using the examples from "/ReferenceFiles/dataExamples". To use the comparison system, paste some data as a text in "/src/input.txt" and run "Index.java" in whatever environment you want to use, the result should show the original file size as well as the results from the different compression algorithms.
