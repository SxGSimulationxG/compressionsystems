\subsubsection{Surrounding System}
\todo{Insert into compression code}
\todo{Return compressed size, number of calculations}

Processes that do not vary between the different compression systems will not be included in the resulting calculation time. The metric of calculation time is supposed to be a comparison between the construction of the compression tree. Therefore, the static compression system that are based on an already constructed compression tree, do not show the metric of the number of calculation processes.
